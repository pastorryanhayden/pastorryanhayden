## Who I Am
I'm a developer from Mattoon, IL.  I'm married to Amanda, we have five kids together.

## Where I work
I serve as the pastor at [Bible Baptist Church](https://biblebaptistmattoon.org) and work regularly on a few passion projects that tie together the worlds of church and development.

## What kind of developer I am
I got started a LONG time ago as a front end developer.  Back in the day, that meant knowing how to make CSS play nicely with early versions of Internet Explorer and knowing all the hacks required to get floats and clears to display correctly.

Then, I learned javascript and started doing some stuff with Nodejs.  Then Vue.  Then Firebase.

Things really took off for me when I learned Laravel and switched to PHP.  Almost all of my work today is done in Laravel and I'm a huge fan of [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com).
